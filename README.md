# Crime-Predictio-And-Risk-Analysis
"An AI/ML-based Crime Prediction and Risk Analysis project that allows users to select a year (2010-2030), state, and district to identify the major crime type in that area. The model also assesses whether the district is a high-risk or low-risk area, providing valuable insights for safety and planning."
